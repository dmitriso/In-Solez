# Project Description
Do you remember back in the day when you showed up to school with a fresh set of kicks? Or do you remember the camaraderie you made with your friends as you showed your shoes off and checked out who had on what. From those days, you have grown older and became a "Sneaker Head."
<br>
<br>
A sneaker head is a sneaker enthusiast who loves to collect, buy, sell, and trade shoes. They are willing to go to the extreme to get the lastest released or classic vintage pair. This can involve camping overnight outside of a shoe store or waiting on an online merchant's site for hours until they drop the lastest shoe. A sneaker head's goal is to collect as many shoes as possible and showcase their sneakers on the street or internet. With that being said, the In-Solez app makes it easier for sneaker heads to do those things. 
<br>
<br>
The name "In-Solez" came from the notion that every sneaker has a sole inside of it that provides comfort and protection for the foot. These soles are an intergral part of the shoe. In the same way, a person's soul is an intergral part of who they are. Their soul consists of their personality and identity. A person may have a physical body on the outside that everyone sees. But it is what is on the inside that makes them who they truly are. The In-Solez app allows the user to express their soul, personality, identity, and style using sneakers.
<br>
<br>
 On the homepage, the user is welcomed with the In-Solez logo, slogan, and an image of a pair of sneakers. They are also able to click several links in the navigation bar: "Home", "Member Profile", "Log In", "Sign Up", and "Search". Users are allowed to create an account using their email and password, which will allow them to login at anytime to view their collection. On the "Member Profile" page, the user is allowed to view their collection of shoes that they have saved or their wishlist of shoes that they are interested in buying. On the "Search" page, the user can search is any kind of sneaker based of its name, brand, gender, colorway, release date, or price. The In-Solez app was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars and several other dependencies. It also used the "The Sneaker Database" API from SwaggerHub as its databse to display all of the sneaker information.
